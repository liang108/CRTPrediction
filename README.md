Personal project using linear regression to determine significant predictors of breast cancer recurrence times in patients with previous treatments. Data obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29) and Dr. William H. Wolberg (U Wisconsin). 

It was concluded that the radius of cell nuclei was a significant predictor of time until recurrence, among other minor results.
